- **Research Hub**:
  - AI/ML integration timeline
  - Risk-based prioritization (TruRisk)
  - Charts and graphs using **Chart.js** or **Recharts**
- **Downloadable Reports**:
  - WAS + IaC scans must generate both **PDF** (use `pdfkit` or `reportlab`) and **JSON**
- **Blog / News Section**:
  - Display 3–5 dummy posts on threat trends, tool updates, cyber insights

📁 ARCHITECTURE:
Let the AI choose the optimal folder structure (e.g., `/backend/`, `/frontend/`, `/templates/`, `/routes/`, `/static/`).

⚙️ SYSTEM CONSTRAINTS:
- Entirely built using **open-source tools**
- Must run in **Replit** (no Docker)
- Backend = Python (Flask or FastAPI)
- Frontend = HTML, JS, Tailwind/Bootstrap
- Vulnerability tools: OWASP ZAP, Checkov CLI

🔚 FINAL NOTES:
- ✅ Footer of every page must say:  
  **“Made by Team CyferTrace”**

🎯 END GOAL:
A fully operational, visually identical Qualys-style cybersecurity platform clone — with two working tools (WAS & IaC), two upcoming tools, full-stack integration, and dynamic reports. Professional-grade, team-branded, and demo-ready.
